# Advent3D

Advent3D is a game engine currently under development. The goal is to make the engine as easy to use, read and expand as possible.

[DISCLAIMER] : the engine is not ready to make a game it is still a work in progress. You can speed up it's development by using the Docs Creator Tool, helping me creating documentation pages for the engine ;)

When the engine is ready (it is not going to be soon) I will announce it here.

## Documentation:

You can find the documentation [here](https://gabrielevierti.github.io/Advent3D-documentation/).

## Contributors:

- Gabriele Vierti : `initial work`

## Dependencies:

This tool uses `GLFW` as windowing API, `GL3W` to load all the OpenGL extensions and the proprietary `Maths` library.
