## Advent3D

Advent3D is a game engine currently under development. The goal is to make the engine as easy to use, read and expand as possible. The development is based on a structure(that you can see below, it still misses plenty of things, but they are going to be added when needed)
, that might not be the best one or the most performant one. For this reason we highly appreciate feedback and pull requests, to suggest changes and/or additions.

The current structure can be seen below:
